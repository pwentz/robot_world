Robot Worldy

Robot World is a simple sinatra application highlighting the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) functionality using
SQLite3. Users can create a new robot with their own personal attributes (name, birthdate, date hired, unique avatar, and more)
to be saved in the database. Each robot has their own page where users can view their full attributes. Users can edit specific 
robot attributes, and even delete any unwanted robots. The user is also presented with various Robot World statistics upon visiting
the homepage.
